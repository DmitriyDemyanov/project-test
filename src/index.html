		<h3>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
			the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
			the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations
			in it, <mark>‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù</mark> thought Alice
			<strong>‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations?‚Äù</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
			day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
			a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
			daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
		</p>

		<p>
			There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
			<em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‚ÄúOh
			dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!‚Äù (when she thought it over afterwards, it
			occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
			it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually
			<i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i> , and looked at it, and
			then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind
			that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or
			a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
			field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
			large rabbit-hole under the hedge
